# Introduction

Imagine you are an Enterprise that owns car service centers. You want to equip service center employees with tablets, and build an app that will help them coordinate activities in the service center to improve service times and quality of service.

On important element on this solution it is to allow your employees to have access to the most accurate data about your customer. As customer can engage with your Enterprise via multiple channels.

> CRM: For this example we will use the CRM idea to be central place to store/retrieve the most updated information about a customer information and it s open and past tickets [Read more about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management)


So through this example we will explore an possible architecture that would allow a Enterprise that already have a OnPrem CRM solution, to expose the CRM data to a MobileApp to its Service Centers employees allowing a better customer service in the end of day.

This Example will cover to main ways to do this:

- **Online/Synchronous**: When you have a the MobileApp app reading and writing to via the CRM apis, as traditional OLAP database. On this scenario, it would push more from the CRM solution to support peaks and valleys of demand from the service center customer flows or the other supported channels.  


- **Streams/Asynchronous**: When we have a MobileApp app reading from a cache data repository updated as frequently as possible, and writing via an messaging system. Allowing the CRM to consume updates on a more controlled flow, mitigating the peaks and valleys of a service center working day. So if required more resource can be added to the CRM to support more load trough the day, to keep data updated on the latency desired.

Topics that will be explored on this solution:

- **MobileApp**:
  - User Authentication: Login/Logout of your app. More details at the [Security Lab](/Lab/5.%20security.md)
  - Exposing APIs to your Mobile Device Clients. More details at the  [Adapters Lab](/Lab/3.%20adapters.md)
  - Easy Update of your API parameters(Zero Code Conf). More details at the [Config API at Adapters Lab](/Lab/3.%20adapters.md#configuration-api)
  - APIs Protection: Only an authenticated user can consume a givens service, exposed to the mobile app.
  - Exploring Ionic for User Interface(MobileDevice App)
  - Collection App Usage Analytics
  - App Lifecycle Management
  - Exploring Bluemix based deployment of MobileFirst Platform


- **Backend**:
  - Mockup CRM: An NodeJS based Application that will act as a fake CRM to allow you easily replicate the content of this sample.
  - Secure Gateway: A set of guides on how to expose your OnPrem CRM to a bluemix Based service in way that can be only be consumed by your Bluemix based apps.
  - DashDB: Using this data store service to act as a mirror of some data in your CRM to allow, reduce the pressure of consuming it online from your onPrem Enviroment and also improving the responsiveness to your MobileApp users.
  - MessageHub: A service to allow a better pipeline to allow a more asynchronous data propagation of the data from your MobileApp to an OnPrem CRM.


# Scenario Considerations

- Replacing a desktop user interface to a system to a mobile based can bring the following challenges to be handled:
  - **More user interaction, more pressure over backend systems**: [MobileFirst Adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/) are a great help to manage the pressure sent to your backend systems.

  - **Mobile users tends to want to have more responsiveness**: [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) can be a good help to create a good user interface that integrates well with MobileFirst Foundation.

  - **Once you have an MobileApp Available, users will demand improvements and new features**: [MobileFirst Console](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/setting-up-your-development-environment/console/) and features like [MobileFirst Direct Update](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/using-the-mfpf-sdk/direct-update/) will help a lot on keeping your app development/delivery lifecycle management in tune with your user demmands.

  - **How to know your mobile app users?**: [MobileFirst Analytics](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/analytics/) will provide you out-of-the-box  information that will help you a lot, but we will also explore ways to collect more data on this.

  - **Mobile App it is one channel from a sort of channels your users could interact with your backend system**: On these labs we will explore [IBM DashDB](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/dashdb/) and [IBM MessageHub](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/message-hub/) to act as part of a pipeline to improve the responsiveness of a mobileApp. Allowing service centers to have the most updated information as possible to act and also controlling the pressure over the backend system.

  - **Mobile Apps are usually served by cloud services, backend systems can be OnPrem**: This example will also explore [IBM Secure Gateway](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/secure-gateway/) to allow MobileFirst On Bluemix to host apis that will propagate changes to a OnPrem System and allowing only MobileFirst App Servers able to reach the OnPrem system from Bluemix. An protected exposure of your OnPrem services. So, it is a standard hybrid cloud scenario.
