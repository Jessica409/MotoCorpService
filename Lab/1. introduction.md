# Overview

This lab will demonstrate how to utilise MobileFirst Foundation capabilities to address Enterprise challenges.

## Background

The scenario is a Motor Service Corps that wants to equip service center employees (customer service reps) with mobile apps to improve customer service & cut service times. 

The customer service reps can search on existing customer and previous appointment data pulled from an on-prem CRM, register a new customer, and create new appointments within the app. 

The data is retrieved securely from an on-prem CRM. Access to the API is protected with mobile optimized user authentication, and adapters. 

In this lab we will be focusing on how to access on-prem systems securely.

## App Demo

In this lab, you will learn how to create and integrate an:

- Ionic MobileFirst App with login screen, customer search, add customer, add visits.

- An adapter that does a secure login with the same username/password, utilizing the MFP security framework to manage an OAuth token

- An adapter that retrieves customer/visit info and adds customers/visits securely by utilizing the login OAuth token and ensuring only authenticated apps are able to access backend information

- A NodeJS app that mocks an on-prem CRM with built in rest API to get and post customer and visit information.

- Secure Gateway to access an on-prem CRM from the cloud in a secure manner.
