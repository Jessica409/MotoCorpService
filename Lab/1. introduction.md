# Overview
This page is for pre-sales to show how and why we chose to build our app.

## Background

This lab will demonstrate how to utilise Foundation capabilities to  Enterprise challenges. The scenario is a Motor Service Corps that wants to equip service center employees (customer service reps) with mobile apps to improve customer service & cut service times. 

The customer service reps can search on existing customer and previous appointment data pulled from an on-prem CRM, register a new customer, and create new appointments within the app. 

The data is retrieved securely from an on-prem CRM. Access to the API is protected with mobile optimized user authentication, and adapters. 

In this lab we will be focusing on how to access on-prem systems securely.

## App Demo

In this lab, you will learn how to create and integrate an:

- Ionic MobileFirst App with login screen, customer search, add customer, add visits.

- An adapter that does a secure login with the same username/password, utilizing the MFP security framework to manage an OAuth token

- An adapter that retrieves customer/visit info and adds customers/visits securely by utilizing the login OAuth token and ensuring only authenticated apps are able to access backend information

- A NodeJS app that mocks an on-prem CRM with built in rest API to get and post customer and visit information.

- Secure Gateway to access an on-prem CRM from the cloud in a secure manner.

## Getting the App Up and Running

To get the app up and running please follow quick start guide [here](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/2.%20quick-start.md).

## Scenario

Imagine you are an Enterprise that owns car service centers. You want to equip service center employees with tablets, and build an app that will help them coordinate activities in the service center to improve service times and quality of service. 

You have an on-prem CRM, and right now your service representatives are using the tablets to access the CRM from a web browser. It's slow, clunky, and ugly to use.

## Exposing Rest APIs
The first thing you will want to do is expose your business services and data, such as the ability to create new customer records or appointments, or view available car parts in inventory, as APIs that can be consumed by your mobile developers. Then you’ll set your mobile team to develop a great app for your employees.

We have mocked this CRM in the lab with a NodeJS application.
Please follow [Step 10](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/2.%20quick-start.md#10---run-the-nodejs-app-which-will-mock-the-on-prem-crm-by-going-into) in the quick start to get the "CRM" up and running.

## Security
When you go about this project, one of the key considerations you’ll likely encounter is how to protect your enterprise APIs from hackers or from access from unsanctioned users, apps, or devices. To do this, you’ll have to make sure clients calling your APIs are authenticated, and have the required permissions to access these APIs. 

The MobileFirst Security framework provides the infrastructure that makes it very easy to implement the authentication & authorization logic to protect your APIs when they are accessed from mobile apps, and enforce it at runtime. And the security framework implements the OAuth2 protocol, which apart from being the industry standard protocol to protect APIs, also makes it easy to leverage additional security products in your infrastructure.

### Login
In this demo app you’ll see a login see a log-in screen where the customer service rep will have to enter a valid username and password (in this lab, valid credentials are to have same username/password) to create and view customer profiles, or create and view new appointments.

![Login](/Lab/img/login.png)

In the [Security Lab](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/5.%20security.md), you will see how Foundation simplifies the development of this security behavior (and many other types) so that your development team doesn’t have to go learn OAUTH2, or become security experts, and can also reuse security logic to protect different APIs or in different apps.

In the guide you’ll see that there are server side and client side building blocks called security checks and challenge handlers respectfully. 

- The security checks are server side entities that implement the server side security logic for protecting your APIs. For example issuing a request to the client to supply user name & password credentials, and receiving and validating the credentials against a user registry.
- The challenge handler is a client side entity that implements the security logic to, in this case, acquire the users credentials when prompted by the server.

The Security Framework provides classes that already implement most of the technical aspects of the security behavior, so that your developers only have to focus on developing the UI and any custom logic. MobileFirst also takes care of activating the security logic at runtime. After the user successfully passes the requires security checks (or tests), in this case supplying a valid user name & password, the Security Frameworks takes care of the the client-server communication that goes on that ultimately results in the client acquiring an access token for the API.

Furthermore, you’ll see how you can easily specify what security checks are required for access to any given API from the MobileFirst Foundation Console. And how it is possible to change security configurations directly from the console, such as the number of attempts a user gets, or the time before a successful log-in expires, that take effect immediately.

![Login Config](/Lab/img/loginconfig.png)

After the customer logs in, they will be able to access the protected resources as long as that token has not expired. So if you set this token to 60 seconds, they will automatically be logged out after 60 seconds. 

You can then configure the customer adapter to access the endpoints in the CRM as shown in this [lab](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/3.%20adapters.md). Because the adapter is mapped to the `user-restricted` scope, every time a resource request is made by client side entity, the MobileFirst framework will automatically check to see if the token is still alive, and if it is not it will redirect the user to login.

```bash
@OAuthSecurity(scope = "user-restricted")
```

The `user-restricted` scope is mapped to the `UserLogin` security check, making it easy for the developer to map the customer adapter to the security scope of the login adapter. The security framework ensures that only a client that passes all of the security checks of the protecting scope is granted access to the resource. You can learn more about security checks in our getting started tutorials [here](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/authentication-and-security/creating-a-security-check/).

You can easily demo this by setting it to a lower timespan in the console, and doing a quick search on customers. So if you set the token to expire in 30 seconds, you can login, do a quick search on customers such as `Lime`, access the customer details, and by this time the token will have expired, so you will be logged out.

### Secure Gateway
Besides restricting access to your APIs from only authenticated users on your mobile apps, you’ll probably have to think about how the backend of your app, which you are building on the cloud, can call into databases and applications that installed on-prem in your data centers, or in separate cloud environments. Often security restrictions and firewalls make these data sources & applications challenging to reach.

The Secure Gateway service in Bluemix solves this issue by securely tunneling through a firewall so that even if your mobile app is not on your compnay network, they can still access data in a secure way.

In this demo, you will see how when you leverage the Secure Gateway service to connect to an on-prem CRM system (this demo has a mock CRM DB that you can host on your computer, and exposes data via a REST API) to provide access to the data you need for your motor service center app, you establish a secure connection that tunnels through a firewall.

To demo this to a customer, you can run the CRM behind a firewall and point the customer adapters to do resource requests to this CRM by using the configuration api as shown [here](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/3.%20adapters.md#configuration-api).

![Login Config](/Lab/img/configAPI.png)

You can then do a getCustomer request in the [Swagger API](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/3.%20adapters.md#swagger-api) like below.

[swagger api](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/3.%20adapters.md#swagger-api)
This will cause an error, as the adapters will not be able to reach the resources behind the firewall.

Then you can change the configuration to point to the endpoint configured through SecureGateway, and try to access the same data through the adapters (such as the Swagger API), and you will now successfully be able to reach that information.

## Conclusion

Getting an app up and running is not hard. Getting an app up and running securely can be a little more difficult. The MobileFirst Framework makes it easy with enterprise grade APIs that allow developers to use the OAuth 2 framework in order to securely access sensitive data from a mobile app.

In this demo, we successfully created a hybrid Ionic MobileFirst app that securely accessed an on-prem CRM.
