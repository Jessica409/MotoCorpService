# Quick Start Guide

This is a quick start guide for getting the MotoCorpService app quickly up and running.
This app is a car service representative mobile app to help service customers. In this app, you can search for customers, add new customers, see customer details, and add new customer visits.

## Setup Environment

- [X] [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- [X] [Ionic cli](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)
```bash
npm install -g cordova ionic
```
- [X] Install the MobileFirst CLI
```bash
npm install -g mfpdev-cli
```
- [X] Make sure to either by using JVM 1.7 or 1.8. You can check your java version in the CLI with
```bash
java -version
```
- [X] Optional for Secure Gateway - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [X] Register with Bluemix: Check out the services [MobileFirst Foundation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-foundation/) and [SecureGateway](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/secure-gateway/)

> Here is a [quick start guide](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/quick-start/cordova/
) on running MobileFirst Apps in Cordova.


## Run the App

### 1 - Add your MobileFirst foundation server with the following. 
Included are the default settings for username/passwords.
```bash
mfpdev server add 
? Enter the name of the new server profile: bluemix-server
? Enter the fully qualified URL of this server: http://<server>:80
? Enter the MobileFirst Server administrator login ID: mfpRESTUser
? Enter the MobileFirst Server administrator password: mfpadmin
? Save the administrator password for this server?: Yes
? Enter the context root of the MobileFirst administration services: mfpadmin
? Enter the MobileFirst Server connection timeout in seconds: 30
? Make this server the default?: (Y/n) Y
```
### 2 - git clone this repo
```bash
mkdir MobileFirstLab
cd MobileFirstLab
git init
git clone https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService.git
git remote add origin https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService.git
```
### 3 - Navigate to MotoCorp in the cli 
```bash
cd MotoCorpService/MotoCorp/
```
### 4 - Add the MobileFirst Plugin 
```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp
```
### 5 - Add the ios plaform
```bash
ionic platform add ios
```
### 6 - Register the application
```bash
mfpdev app register
```
### 7 - Build the ios platform. You will need to do this every time you make a change in the app.
```bash
ionic build ios
```
### 8 - Build the adapters and deploy them with 
The CustomerInfo adapter is to query, add, and view customer info.
```bash
cd ../Adapters/CustomerInfo
mfpdev adapter build
mfpdev adapter deploy
```
The SecureGatewayAdapter and SecureGatewayBinder is to allow the app to use SecureGateway.
> **note:* This step requires the secure gateway setup to be already done, to allow the right properties to be provided on the adapter, defore deploying it. 
```bash
cd ../SecureGatewayAdapter
mfpdev adapter build
mfpdev adapter deploy
```

The UserLogin adapter is used to perform the authentication of a user before allow access to resources.
```bash
cd ../UserLogin
mfpdev adapter build
mfpdev adapter deploy
```
### 9 - In the MobileFirst Operations Console add the scope to map your user-restricted scope to UserLogin
This will map the security check to call the UserLogin adapter to validate a user has the same username and password.

### 10 - Run the NodeJS app which will mock the on-prem CRM by going into
```bash
cd ../onPremSimulator/demo_server
npm install
node server.js
```
### 11 - Set up Secure Gateway
Please see lab [2.1. quick-start-sgw](./2.1.%20quick-start-sgw.md). for further instructions on how to set up SecureGateway. Doing this will create a secure tunnel through a firewall for your app to gain access to an on-prem resource. 
This is optional to getting this app up and running, but without this service will not be able to access a resource across a firewall.

### 12 - Check in the operations console to make sure CustomerInfo adapter is pointing to `http://localhost:8080/customers` or your SecureGatewayEndpoint.

### 13 - You can now view your app by emulating it in the simulator.
```bash
ionic emulate ios
```
### 14 - Login to the app with the same username/password (at least 4 characters, pre-populated).
You will now be able to search customers, add new customers, add new visits.
You can search for a customers like "Lime."
