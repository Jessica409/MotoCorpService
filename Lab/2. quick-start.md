> Here is a [quick start guide](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/quick-start/cordova/
) on running MobileFirst Apps in Cordova.


## Run the App

1. Add your MobileFirst foundation server with the following. 
Included are the default settings for username/passwords.
```bash
mfpdev server add 
? Enter the name of the new server profile: bluemix-server
? Enter the fully qualified URL of this server: http://<server>:80
? Enter the MobileFirst Server administrator login ID: mfpRESTUser
? Enter the MobileFirst Server administrator password: mfpadmin
? Save the administrator password for this server?: Yes
? Enter the context root of the MobileFirst administration services: mfpadmin
? Enter the MobileFirst Server connection timeout in seconds: 30
? Make this server the default?: (Y/n) Y
2. git clone this repo
```bash
mkdir MobileFirstLab
cd MobileFirstLab
git init
git clone https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService.git
git remote add origin https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService.git
```
3. Navigate to MotoCorp in the cli 
```bash
cd MotoCorp
```
4. Add the MobileFirst Plugin 
```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp
```
5. Register the application
```bash
mfpdev app register
```
6. Add the ios plaform
```bash
ionic platform add ios
```
7. Build the ios platform. You will need to do this every time you make a change in the app.
```bash
ionic build ios
```
8. Build the adapters and deploy them with 
```bash
cd ../Adapters/CustomerInfo
mfpdev adapters build
mfpdev adapters deploy
cd ../SecureGatewayAdapter
mfpdev adapters build
mfpdev adapters deploy
cd ../SecureGatewayBinder
mfpdev adapters build
mfpdev adapters deploy
```
9. In the MobileFirst Operations Console add the scope to map your user-restricted scope to UserLogin

10. Run the NodeJS app by going into
```bash
cd ../onPremSimulator/demo_server
node server.js
```
11. Set up Secure Gateway :pushpin: Cesar
12. Check in the operations console to make sure CustomerInfo adapter is pointing to `http://localhost:8080/customers`.

13. You can now view your app by emulating it in the simulator `ionic emulate ios`
```bash
ionic emulate ios
```
14. Login to the app with the same username/password (at least 4 characters, pre-populated).
You will now be able to search customers, add new customers, add new visits.
