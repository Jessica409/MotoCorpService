```bash
cd MotoCorp
```

2. Add the MobileFirst Plugin `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp`

3. Add the ios plaform `ionic platform add ios`

4. Add your MobileFirst foundation server with `mfpdev server add` and following the instructions with server as `https://<host>:443`

5. Build the adapters and deploy them with `mfpdev adapters build`, `mfpdev adapters deploy`

6. Run the NodeJS app by going into `cd onPremSimulator/demo_server` and running `node server.js`

7. Check in the operations console to make sure CustomerInfo adapter is pointing to `http://localhost:8080/customers`
