# Customer Adapters Overview

When building this appplication, we created a java adapter in order to gain access to backend resources securely.

MobileFirst Adapters are Maven projects that contain server-side code implemented in either Java or JavaScript.
Adapters are used perform any necessary server-side logic, and to transfer and retrieve information from back-end systems to client applications and cloud services. The adapters follow the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) specification so you'll see JAX-RS annotations like `@Consumes`, `@Context`, `@Path`, `@Produces`, etc. thoughout the adapter

The customer adapter we go over in this lab uses secure gateway to securely bridge the gap between the mobile client app and the on-prem CRM.

By using adapters, you easily also secure the calls to the backend with the MobileFirst Foundation built in OAUTH based security framework, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive customer or enterprise information.

> Requirements: Please make sure to do steps 8-11 in the quick start guide to get the adapters, CRM, and SecureGateway Service up and running before going through this lab.

# Background

This section covers a more advanced technical background on how adapters work.
To proceed to learning about how to create procedures ("requests") in adapters, please proceed to [Creating Procedures in the Adapter](#Creating-Procedures-in-the-Adapter)

## Http Client

To connect to the on-prem CRM we need to use an HTTP client. In this case we are creating an abstraction layer (`HttpRequestUtil`) between the HTTP Client and the CustomerInfo adapter.

> **NOTE:** `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` is available out of the box in the adapter and does not need to be included in the `pom.xml`

`HttpRequestUtil` exposes 3 methods for different requests types `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT`. The `HttpRequestUtil` constructor takes the CRM endpoint as a paramter and the respective methods `get`, `post`, and `put` take the relative path along with a payload for `post` and `put`.

```
public class HttpRequestUtil {
    private String uri;
    private HttpClient client;

    public HttpRequestUtil(String uri) {
        this.uri = uri;
        client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();
    }

    public String get(String path) throws URISyntaxException, IOException {
        HttpGet request = new HttpGet(uri + path);
        request.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

        return execute(request);
    }

    public String post(String path, byte[] payload) throws URISyntaxException, IOException {
        HttpPost request = new HttpPost(uri + path);
        request.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        request.setEntity(new ByteArrayEntity(payload));

        return execute(request);
    }

    public String put(String path, byte[] payload) throws URISyntaxException, IOException {
        HttpPut request = new HttpPut(uri + path);
        request.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        request.setEntity(new ByteArrayEntity(payload));

        return execute(request);
    }

    private String execute(HttpUriRequest request) throws IOException {
        HttpResponse response = client.execute(request);

        return EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity());
    }
}

```

## Data Objects

Since the adapter will be handling data objects, we will create POJOs (plain old java objects) for each entity we handle i.e., `CustomerVisit`, `Customer`, and `SearchFilter`. These object contains the specification, properties, of each data object that the adapter consumes.

### CustomerVisit

```
public class CustomerVisit {
    public Date date;
    public String comment;
    public String type;
}
```

### Customer

```
public class Customer {
    public String name;
    public String plate;
    public String make;
    public String model;
    public String vin;
    public CustomerVisit[] visits;
}
```

### SearchFilter

```
public class SearchFilter {
    public String name;
    public String vin;
    public String plate;
}
```

# Creating Procedures in the Adapter

Now that we have covered the HTTP abstraction layer we can move on to the adapter procedures where we create the following rest endpoints.

By creating these procedures within the adapter that produce rest endpoints, we let MobileFirst handle the OAuth handshake between the client app and the server, while creating an easily consumable way to use these resources.

The following rest endpoints are used in our app to search customers and create/view customers and visits.
In the next section, we go into more detail about how we create these procedures.

- [GET] `/customers` to get all customers
- [POST] `/customers` create new customers
- [POST] `/customers/search` to search through customers based on different elements
- [GET] `/customers/{id}` get a customer by id
- [GET] `/customers/{id}/visits` get a customer's visits
- [GET] `/customers/{id}/visits`or create a new visit

## Implementing the adapter resource

To get started we need to do dependency injection in the `CustomerInfoResource` adapter. We start by passing in `ConfigurationAPI` and `AdaptersAPI`. The we instantiate a `HttpRequestUtil` instance with the CRM endpoint obtained from the adapter configuration.

```
@Consumes("application/json")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@OAuthSecurity(scope = "user-restricted")
@Path("/customers")
public class CustomerInfoResource {
    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(CustomerInfoResource.class.getName());
    private HttpRequestUtil httpRequestUtil;
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;
    
    public CustomerInfoResource(@Context ConfigurationAPI configApi, @Context AdaptersAPI adaptersAPI) throws URISyntaxException {
        httpRequestUtil = new HttpRequestUtil(configApi.getPropertyValue("onPremCRMAddress"));
        objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
        objectMapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL);
    }
}
```

### Validating the Secure Gateway bridge

> Please see the [SecureGateway lab](./6.%20secure-gateway.md) to learn more about the implementation for this. 

We have a dedicated adapter `SecureGatewayAdapter` for creating the Secure Gateway tunnel. To enable the secure tunnel we will call the `SecureGatewayAdater` from the `CustomerInfo` adapter

```
/**
 * Check and Fix Secure gateway bridge
 *
 * @throws IOException
 */
private void validateSecureGatewayBridge(AdaptersAPI adaptersAPI) throws IOException {
  logger.info("validateSecureGatewayBridge:");
  HttpUriRequest req = new HttpGet("/SecureGatewayAdapter/secure/updateFirewall");
  req.addHeader("Accept", "text/plain");
  HttpResponse response = adaptersAPI.executeAdapterRequest(req);
  logger.info("validateSecureGatewayBridge: done" + response.toString());
}
```

After creating the `validateSecureGatewayBridge` we need to invoke it in the constructor as follows

```
public CustomerInfoResource(@Context ConfigurationAPI configApi, @Context AdaptersAPI adaptersAPI) throws URISyntaxException {
  httpRequestUtil = new HttpRequestUtil(configApi.getPropertyValue("onPremCRMAddress"));
  objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
  objectMapper.setSerializationInclusion(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL);

  try {
    //enable access to CRM - Secure Gateway
    validateSecureGatewayBridge(adaptersAPI);
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
```

### Get all customers

To get a list of customer we make an HTTP GET request to the CRM endpoint

```
@GET
public Response getCustomers() throws Exception {
  String response = httpRequestUtil.get("");

  return Response.ok(response).build();
}
```

### Create customer

The new customer endpoint receives a JSON payload from the client (mobile) application. The JSON object is mapped to a `Customer` then we convert the object to a byte array to send it to the CRM endpoint 

```
@POST
public Response newCustomer(Customer customer) throws Exception {
    byte[] payload = objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(customer);

    String response = httpRequestUtil.post("", payload);

    return Response.ok(response).build();
}
```

### Get customer by id

To get the customer details we obtain the user id from the adapter path `{id}`, append the user id to the CRM uri, and then make a GET request

```
@GET
@Path("/{id}")
public Response getCustomerByID(@PathParam("id") Integer id) throws Exception {

    String body = httpRequestUtil.get(id + "");

    return Response.ok(body).build();
}
```

### Get customer visits
To get the customer visits for a specific customer we obtain the user id from the adapter path `{id}`, append the user id to the CRM uri, add the `/visits` path, and then make a GET request.

```
@GET
@Path("/{id}/visits")
public Response getCustomerVisitsByID(@PathParam("id") Integer id) throws Exception {

    String response = httpRequestUtil.get(id + "/visits");

    return Response.ok(response).build();
}
```

### Add customer visit
The new customer visit endpoint receives a JSON payload from the client (mobile) application. The JSON object is mapped to a `newVisit` then we convert the object to a byte array to send it to the CRM endpoint. 

```
@POST
@Path("/{id}/visits")
public Response newVisit(CustomerVisit newVisit, @PathParam("id") Integer id) throws Exception {
    byte[] payload = objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(newVisit);

    String body = httpRequestUtil.post(id + "/visits/", payload);

    return Response.ok(body).build();
}
```

### Search customers
The customer search endpoint receives a JSON payload from the client (mobile) application. The JSON object is mapped to a `filter` then we convert the object to a byte array to send it to the CRM endpoint. This endpoint takes the filter to search for a customer, it does not change any CRM data.

```
@POST
@Path("/search")
public Response searchCustomers(SearchFilter filter) throws Exception {

    byte[] payload = objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(filter);

    String body = httpRequestUtil.post("_search", payload);

    return Response.ok(body).build();
}
```

## Swagger API
MobileFirst incorporates the Swagger API so that a developer can test the adapter endpoints before they are consumed by a client application.
The Swagger docs UI is a visual representation of an adapter's REST endpoints.

If you want to add a description with an accompanying sample code you can add the following before your adapter procedure. The `@APIOperation` hold the title and description. The `@APIResponse` shows corresponding status codes and a sample body. This example for the getCustomer procedure.
```bash
@ApiOperation(value = "List Customers", notes = "List containing all the customers in the CRM is returned")
@ApiResponses(value = {@ApiResponse(code = 200, message = "A array containing all the customers", response = Customer.class, responseContainer = "List")})
```

By testing the rest endpoints before integrating them with the client app, a developer can validate the procedures in the adapters and see the result.

You can view these rest endpoints through Swagger docs from the MFP console.
`http://<host>/doc/?url=/mfp/api/adapterdoc/CustomerInfo#!`

To test the procedures with Swagger docs, you will need to toggle the security and map the scope to `user-restricted`.
Set a confidential client in runtime settings with
- client id = test
- client secret = test
- allowed scope = user-restricted

![get all customers](/Lab/img/confidential-clients.png)

Next, toggle the adapter security off for the corresponding procedure, map it to user-security, then type in admin/password as test/test.
When you then [GET] /customers, you should see the output from the following configuration.

![get all customers](/Lab/img/getCustomers.png)

## Configuration API

To utilize the MobileFirst configuration API, you will need to import the configAPI so that you can change where your adapter can point to for the CRM. You will be able to change this configuration in the adapter.xml like `<property name="onPremCRMAddress" defaultValue="<host>:port/customers/"/>` or the MobileFirst operations xml.

```bash
@Context
ConfigurationAPI configApi;
String url = configApi.getPropertyValue("onPremCRMAddress");
```
