# Mock CRM
> Pictures and clear concise steps are important as well as making it clear why we are doing each step.

## Overview
- What is this NodeJS mocking?
- the customer service rep on prem CRM

## What does it do?
- Talk about customer search, customer details, new customer, new visit

## How to get node app up and running
- node server.js

## Rest API
- Document the rest endpoints
- Show how to use with postman (maybe with screenshots?)
- I think it's important to show customers how to debug
