# Mock CRM

## Overview
In this step, we will create a mock CRM that will hold our customerâ€™s information. We will use this information when performing a customer search, retrieving customer details, and creating a new customer and new visit. This mock CRM will be done through a Nodejs app with several REST endpoints that the client app will use to call.

# Setup Node App
```bash
#Clone Repo
git clone git@github.ibm.com:cord-americas/MotoCorpService.git

# install pre-req
cd ./MotoCorpService/onPremSimulator/demo_server/
npm install

#run server
node server.js

#call to test the server
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/
```
## REST API Endpoints (server.js)

## GET - / 
- This is the root endpoint that will list all customers in the CRM.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/ -vv
# Expected: Result
# 200 
# []
```

## GET - /customers
- List all customers in the CRM.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers -vv
# Expected: Result
# 200 
# []
```



## GET - /customers/:id 
- Returns a single customer record.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1 -vv
# Expected: Result
# 200 
# []
```



## GET - /customers/:customerId/visits/ 
- Returns array of visits corresponding to the customerID.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/ -vv

# Expected: Result
# 200 
# []
```

## GET - /customers/:customerId/visits/:visitId 
- Returns a single visit

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  "date": "2016-06-23",  "type": "oil visit",  "comment": "hello this is a comment"}' "http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/1" -vv

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/ -vv

##200
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/1 -vv


## Customer not found:
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/44/visits/1 -vv

## Visit not found:
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/10 -vv

```
## POST - /customers/_search 
- The JSON Object is a filter to be used to search on the DB for name or plates like `{"name":"Rick"}` or `{"plates":"12345"}`.

> This post does not update the DB, it is a view.

```bash
# 200
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  "plate":"ETS-9876" }' "http://localhost:8080/customers/_search" -vv

# 200 - array empty - [] if it is not found
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  "plate":"NONON" }' "http://localhost:8080/customers/_search" -vv

```
## POST - /customers
- This creates a new customer

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Bob", "plate": "1234" }' "http://localhost:8080/customers/" -vv
```

## POST - /customers/:customerId/visits/ 
- Creates a new visit record in the customer specified by customerId in the url

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{  "date": "2016-06-23",  "type": "oil visit",  "comment": "hello this is a comment"}' "http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits" -vv

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "id":1 , "date": "2016-06-23",  "type": "oil visit",  "comment": "hello this is a comment - new comment"}' "http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits" -vv

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/ -vv

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "id":1 , "date": "2016-06-23",  "type": "oil visit",  "comment": "hello this is a comment - new comment update again"}' "http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits" -vv

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/customers/1/visits/ -vv

```
