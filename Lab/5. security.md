# Security

## Overview

When the app is first launched, it will take you to a login screen where you can securely sign into the app.
The username and password used in the security adapter logic is to have the same username and password.

In this lab you will explore the **Auth** service that will communicate between the **login controller** and the **security adapter**.

Let's take a look at how this works.

> Make sure that you first go through the [UI Adapter Integration lab](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/4.%20ui-adapter-integration.md) to familiarize yourself with the Ionic concepts of services, controllers, and views.

## Auth Service

In the **services/auth.js** file, add the **login** function near the bottom of the file under the comment **Add the login code here**

```js
login: function ($scope, username, password) {
      _$scope = $scope;

      // register the challenge handler for `UserLogin`
      bindChallengeHandler();

      if (!username || !password) {
        $scope.$emit('login-error', {
          message: 'Username and Password are required.'
        });
      } else if (authInProgress) {
        // if the authorization is in progress then submit the user credentials to the challenge handler
        challengeHandler.submitChallengeAnswer({'username': username, 'password': password});
      } else {
        // the first time the user clicks login submit the user credentials along with the security check name `UserLogin`
        WLAuthorizationManager.login(securityCheckName, {'username': username, 'password': password});
      }
    }
```

The **login()** function uses the username and password that you type in and sends it to the UserLogin security adapter via the `WLAuthorizationManager.login` function to validate the credentials.

> We are using the [UserLogin Adapter](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/authentication-and-security/user-authentication/security-check/) from the Getting Started tutorials. Please familiarize yourself with this in order to better understand the logic implemented on the client side.

## Login Controller
In the **login.js** file, add the following code in the **doLogin()** function under the comment **"Add login code here"**.

```js
Auth.login($scope, this.username.toLowerCase(), this.password.toLowerCase());
authInProgress = true;
```
The Auth.login() function sends the $scope object from the controller along with the **username and password** you enter to the Auth service.

Once authenticated, you will be redirected to the customer search page.
If the login credentials are invalid, you will receive a popup describing the error.
```js
  $scope.$on('login-success', function () {
    authInProgress = false;
    $state.go('app.search');
  });

  $scope.$on('login-error', function (event, error) {
    alert(error.message);

    authInProgress = false;
  });
```

You will need to map the `user-restricted` scope to the `UserLogin` security check inside the application security settings in the MobileFirst Operations Console.
