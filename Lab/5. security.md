# Security

## Overview

When the app is first launched, it will take you to a login screen where you can securely sign into the app. In this lab you will explore the **Auth** service that will communicate between the **login controller** and the **security adapter**.

Let's take a look at how this works.

> Make sure that you first go through the [UI Adapter Integration lab](https://github.ibm.com/cord-americas/MotoCorpService/blob/master/Lab/4.%20ui-adapter-integration.md) to familiarize yourself with the Ionic concepts of services, controllers, and views.

## Auth Service

In the **services/auth.js** file, add the **login** function near the bottom of the file under the comment **Add the login code here**

```js
login: function ($scope, username, password) {
      _$scope = $scope;

      // register the challenge handler for `UserLogin`
      bindChallengeHandler();

      if (!username || !password) {
        $scope.$emit('login-error', {
          message: 'Username and Password are required.'
        });
      } else if (authInProgress) {
        // if the authorization is in progress then submit the user credentials to the challenge handler
        challengeHandler.submitChallengeAnswer({'username': username, 'password': password});
      } else {
        // the first time the user clicks login submit the user credentials along with the security check name `UserLogin`
        WLAuthorizationManager.login(securityCheckName, {'username': username, 'password': password});
      }
    }
```

The **login()** function uses the username and password that you type in and sends it to the UserLogin security adapter via the `WLAuthorizationManager.login` function to validate the credentials.

> We are using the [UserLogin](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/authentication-and-security/user-authentication/security-check/) from the Getting Started tutorials.

## Login Controller
In the **login.js** file, add the following code in the **doLogin()** function under the comment **"Add login code here"**.

```js
Auth.login($scope, this.username.toLowerCase(), this.password.toLowerCase());
authInProgress = true;
```
The Auth.login() function sends the $scope object from the controller along with the **username and password** you enter to the Auth service.
