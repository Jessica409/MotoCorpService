# UI - Adapter Integration

## Overview
Our UI was done using Ionic 1 and is located in the MotoCorpService/MotoCorp directory. In this lab, you will integrate the UI with the CustomerInfo adapter which talks to the CRM nodejs backend.

# Structure of the App

For our Ionic app, the interesting parts are located in the /MotoCorp/www/app directory. Each view has a corresponding controller and uses CRM service from the /services directory.


| Code Reference     | html             | controller    | service                           | adapter      |
|:-------------------|:-----------------|:--------------|:----------------------------------|:-------------|
| crmService         | no html          | no controller | crm.js                            | CustomerInfo |
| loginView          | login.html  | login.js      | auth.js                          | UserLogin    |
| customerSearchView | search.html      | search.js     | calls crmService| -            |
| newCustomerView    | new-customer.html | new-customer.js   | calls crmService| -            |
| customerDetailView | view-customer.html    | view-customer.js   | calls crmService| -            |
| newVisitView       | new-visit.html    | new-visit.js      | calls crmService| -            |

## Start Nodejs Server
Before we start, first make sure that you start your **Nodejs backend server**. This is where your app will get the customer information from.
```bash 
cd onPremSimulator/demo_server
npm install
node server.js
```

To test that your server is up and running, you should see a json response when you run:

`curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/customers
`
## Customer Search
We will first integrate the search feature to reach the nodejs server.

Add the scope variables that we will use in the `search.js` directory.
```js
$scope.results = [];
$scope.searchType = {
    name:""
  };
```

Inside the `$scope.searchPlate` function, add the following code:

```
// Get the search payload
var search = {};
search[$scope.searchType.name] = this.query;

/* This sends the search payload to the search
  function at the CRM service. */
    CRM.search(search).then(function (results) {
      if(results.length === 0) {
        alert('No match found');
      } else {
        $scope.results = results;
        $scope.$apply();
      }
    }).fail(function (error) {
      alert(error);
    });
```

Open the **CRM** Service (**app/services/crm.js**) and under the **search** function you will see that it is sending a **POST** to the `/adapters/CustomerInfo/customers/search` adapter endpoint.

You can see how this endpoint works in the Adapters lab.


## POST - /customers/_search

HTML: search.html

Controller: search.js

### How it works:

When a customer selects a search type, enters a search query, and hits the search button, the payload (json object) is sent to the CustomerInfo adapter.

This can search on name or plates `{"name":"Rick"}` or `{"plates":"12345"}`.

## Customer Details
## GET - /customers/:id

HTML: view-customer.html

Controller: view-customer.js

### How it works:

When a customer goes to the customer details page, it will pass the customer ID and do a get on the :id endpoint.

## GET - /customers/:customerId/visits

On the customer details page, it will pass the customer ID to get all the correlating visits to that customer.

## New Customer Visit
## POST - /customers/:customerId/visits/

HTML: new-visit.html

Controller: new-visit.js

### How it works:

When a customer hits the plus button to add a new customer visit, it will hit the /visits endpoint. The properties in the body are date, type, and comment.

```
{
  "date": "2016-06-23",
  "type": "oil visit",
  "comment": "hello this is a comment"
}
```

## New Customer

## POST - /customers

HTML: new-customer.html

Controller: new-customer.js

### How it works:

When a customer hits the plus button to add a new customer, it will post to the /customers endpoint. The properties in the body are name, plate, make, model, and vin. The id will automatically be generated.

```
{
  "name": "Jack Reacher",
  "plate": "ETS-9876",
  "make": "Honda",
  "model": "Accord",
  "vin": "1234567890"
}
```
