# Customer Adapters

## Overview
The customer adapter uses secure gateway to securely bridge the gap between the mobile client app and the on-prem CRM.

## How does foundation play a part in this
By using adapters, the developer is able to use the security framework Foundation offers to ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive client information.

## Procedures
- `/customers` to get all customers [get] or create new customers [post]
- `/customers/search` to search through customers based on different elements
- `/customers/{id}` get a customer by id
- `/customers/{id}/visits` get a customer's visits [get] or create a new visit [post]

## Swagger API
You can view these rest endpoints through swagger
`http://<host>/doc/?url=/mfp/api/adapterdoc/CustomerInfo#!`

To test the procedures with swagger docs, you will need to toggle the security and map the scope to `user-restricted`. The amind/password is test/test.
