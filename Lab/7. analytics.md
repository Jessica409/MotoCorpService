# Analytics

## Overview
Foundation analytics is used to monitor app usage and how to continually help improve the app so that customer service reps can more easily and quickly assist customres.

## Analytics Console
Once you send analytics to your analytics server, you will see some default information come up in the analytics console.
Here are some screenshots of information you would see.

## Custom Analytics
Using custom analytics, you can create charts that help your organization better analyze how to better server your business needs.
Documentation about custom analytics can be found [here](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/analytics/custom-charts/).

In this app, there are a couple of different custom analytics put in.

> Please note that you will not be able to see the custom analytics property (i.e. "NewVisit") until an analytics log of that property has been sent to the analytics server. Please run through the app at least once before creating the custom charts.

### 1 - New Visits Created in the App

In `MotoCorp/www/app/controllers/new-visit.js`, the following code adds custom analytics.

```bash
/* Custom analytics tracking how many new customers created in app */
WL.Analytics.log({ NewVisit: '1' }, results);         
WL.Analytics.send();
```
