#  Mobile Foundation - Implement Login(Security)


## What you will learn on this guide

 In this section you will learn how to implement a secure login for your application. 
 The next step in creating this app is to create the security to authenticate a user before they can access sensitive customer information. 
 We will do this by using the MobileFirst security framework to easily implement the OAuth2 protocal to do a handshake with the server for a live token every time a resource request is made via the adapter.

 When the app is first launched, it will take you to a login screen where you can sign into the app.
 In our example, the username and password used in the security adapter logic is such that the user name and password are the same values.

 In this lab you will explore the **Auth** service that will communicate between the **login controller** and the **security adapter**.

 Let's take a look at how this works.

## Client Side Configuration 



# Notes

```
2. (Security) Implement Login
    1. login adapter (deploy adapter/console config, create a client secret)
