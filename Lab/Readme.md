@dora will be out at 9th, 10th  - 8th(deadline)
- Hard deadline: Nov, 11th
- Present to Carmel: Nov, 14th


```
B2: How deep we need to explain this code? Probably not so deep, for the sake of clarity.

R6: It is not confirmed if the adapter is posting data to the MessageHub(topic)

R7: It is possible the consumer is not working as expected

B1: we are not sure if the Consumer is working as expected, tests are failing.


- Environment and the you use
- Focus on Visits updates

Observations:
R1: *Someone* will verify the CRM - Test the *entire flow*, the CRM running locally. -> `(new R1) How to just test the CRM interfaces, not the entire flow. ()`
-> Postman/CURL -> see if the data appears on dashdb

R2: Code for Java to protect - Cesar, still pending.

R3: Confirm if the endpoint its ok for the CRM - done, the Yml update yoel - Done

R4: The app it is not working, the adapter integration it is not ok. (the new customer endpoint, it is not working)
  - Login works
  - Search works
  - DashDb Works
  - MessageHub not ok -> not working on Robs account pointing to doras account)
  -
R5: To investigate if foundation analytics is able to be used. - Not part of this delivery for now. Dora, needs to talk with ajay.

R6: To protected the Customer adapter - Pending
